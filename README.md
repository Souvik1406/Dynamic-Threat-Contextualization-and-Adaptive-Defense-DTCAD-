# Dynamic Threat Contextualization and Adaptive Defense (DTCAD)

## Overview

**Dynamic Threat Contextualization and Adaptive Defense (DTCAD)** is an innovative, ML-based solution designed to enhance cybersecurity by dynamically understanding the context of threats and adapting defense strategies in real-time. DTCAD leverages a combination of anomaly detection, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning to provide context-aware threat detection and adaptive defense mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Context-Aware Threat Detection**: Uses unsupervised and supervised learning models to detect threats while considering the current environment, including network traffic patterns, user behavior, and other contextual factors.
- **Real-Time Adaptive Defense Mechanism**: Employs reinforcement learning to determine and refine defense actions based on the outcomes of previous responses.
- **Integration of External Threat Intelligence**: Incorporates external threat intelligence feeds and utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to enrich data with unstructured threat information.
- **Explainable AI for Security Analysts**: Provides human-readable explanations of its decisions to help security analysts understand why specific actions were taken.
- **Automated Reporting and Visualization**: Generates customizable reports and visualizations to offer insights into detected threats and defensive actions.
- **Self-Learning from Incident Outcomes**: Continuously learns from the effectiveness of its actions, improving its accuracy and effectiveness over time.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Azure Subscription with Sentinel and Log Analytics Workspace
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `azure-kusto-data`

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dtcad.git
   cd dtcad
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your Azure credentials and workspace details in the provided script files.

## Data Ingestion

The DTCAD system ingests security logs from Azure Sentinel using Azure Data Explorer. Here's a basic example of how to query and preprocess this data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from azure.kusto.data import KustoClient, KustoConnectionStringBuilder

KUSTO_CLUSTER = 'https://your_kusto_cluster.kusto.windows.net'
KUSTO_DATABASE = 'your_kusto_database'
KCSB = KustoConnectionStringBuilder.with_aad_device_authentication(KUSTO_CLUSTER)
client = KustoClient(KCSB)

QUERY = '''
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, EventID, Account, IpAddress, EventDescription
'''

response = client.execute(KUSTO_DATABASE, QUERY)
data = pd.DataFrame(response.primary_results[0])
data.head()
```

## Model Development

### Anomaly Detection (Unsupervised Learning)

The system uses an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in the ingested data:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

data['TimeGenerated'] = pd.to_datetime(data['TimeGenerated'])
data['Hour'] = data['TimeGenerated'].dt.hour

features = ['Hour', 'EventID']

model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05)
data['Anomaly'] = model.fit_predict(data[features])

anomalies = data[data['Anomaly'] == -1]
print(f"Detected {len(anomalies)} anomalies.")
```

### Threat Classification (Supervised Learning)

A Random Forest classifier is trained to classify detected threats:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

data['Label'] = ...  # Add logic to label your data for supervised learning

X = data[features]
y = data['Label']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Real-Time Adaptive Defense (Reinforcement Learning)

The system uses a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically adjust defense strategies based on the context and outcomes of previous responses:

```python
import numpy as np

states = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 0]])
actions = [0, 1]  # 0: Do nothing, 1: Block IP

q_table = np.zeros((len(states), len(actions)))

def get_reward(state, action):
    if action == 1 and state[1] == 1:
        return 10
    else:
        return -1

for episode in range(100):
    state_index = np.random.choice(len(states))
    action = np.random.choice(actions)

    reward = get_reward(states[state_index], action)
    q_table[state_index, action] += 0.1 * (reward - q_table[state_index, action])

print("Trained Q-table:\n", q_table)
```

## Visualization

Visualize the insights and results of the models using Seaborn and Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.lineplot(x='TimeGenerated', y='Anomaly', data=data)
plt.title('Detected Anomalies Over Time')
plt.show()

sns.countplot(y="Label", data=data, palette="muted")
plt.title("Threat Classification Results")
plt.show()

sns.heatmap(q_table, annot=True, cmap="YlGnBu", cbar=False)
plt.title('Q-table: Reinforcement Learning Results')
plt.show()
```

## Continuous Learning and Improvement

DTCAD continuously learns from new data and updates its models accordingly:

```python
def retrain_models(new_data):
    new_features = new_data[features]
    model.fit(new_features)
    classifier.fit(X, y)
    # Optionally, save the models
    # joblib.dump(model, 'anomaly_model.pkl')
    # joblib.dump(classifier, 'threat_classifier.pkl')

new_data = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Replace with actual new data
retrain_models(new_data)
```

## Creator Details

This model is tested on limited data and needs to be fine-tuned further
